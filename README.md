Welcome to Project Interface!
===================

The following project is developed during the [Innovation Labs 2016](innovationlabs.ro) pre-accelerator program.

We want to build a smart, contextually aware device that understands userâ€™s needs and delivers valuable information about the world around,  takes out the frustration of going to new places or meeting new people and ultimately allows a person with sight loss to be more independent, with greater sense of mobility and empowerment.
